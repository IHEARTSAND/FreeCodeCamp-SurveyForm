This project involves creating a survey form using HTML and basic CSS for styling. Here's a summary of its importance and the skills I learned during its development:

Importance of the Project:
This project demonstrates how to build a functional web form, an essential skill for web development. Survey forms are commonly used for gathering user feedback, conducting research, or collecting information, and they serve as a great way to understand user interaction on websites.

Skills I Learned:
HTML Structure:

I reinforced my knowledge of properly structuring an HTML document, including the use of semantic elements like <form>, <label>, and <input>.
I also emphasized the importance of using IDs and classes to create accessible and well-organized forms.
Form Design and Inputs:

I learned how to create various types of form fields such as text, email, number inputs, and radio buttons for user selections.
I understood how to group related form elements using <fieldset> for better accessibility and user experience.
Validations:

I learned how to add built-in form validation using the required attribute, setting minimum and maximum values, and using appropriate input types for fields like email and number.
Dropdown Menus:

I practiced creating a dropdown list using the <select> and <option> elements to give users a selection of predefined answers.
Checkboxes and Radio Buttons:

I implemented checkboxes and radio buttons to give users multiple or single selections, allowing for more dynamic and flexible data collection.
Accessibility:

I focused on creating a user-friendly and accessible form by using proper labels, IDs, and making sure the form elements are navigable and clear to the user.
CSS Integration:

I learned how to link external stylesheets (styles.css) to structure and style the form.
By working on this project, I gained a foundational understanding of form creation in HTML, the ability to handle different types of user inputs, and the basics of web accessibility and user interface design.
