# Survey Form Project

## Importance of the Project:
This project demonstrates how to build a functional web form, an essential skill for web development. Survey forms are commonly used for gathering user feedback, conducting research, or collecting information, and they serve as a great way to understand user interaction on websites.

## Skills Learned:

### 1. HTML Structure:
- Reinforced how to properly structure an HTML document, including the use of semantic elements like `<form>`, `<label>`, and `<input>`.
- Emphasized the importance of using IDs and classes to create accessible and well-organized forms.

### 2. Form Design and Inputs:
- Learned how to create various types of form fields such as text, email, number inputs, and radio buttons for user selections.
- Understood how to group related form elements using `<fieldset>` for better accessibility and user experience.

### 3. Validations:
- Learned how to add built-in form validation using the `required` attribute, setting minimum and maximum values, and using appropriate input types for fields like email and number.

### 4. Dropdown Menus:
- Practiced creating a dropdown list using the `<select>` and `<option>` elements to give users a selection of predefined answers.

### 5. Checkboxes and Radio Buttons:
- Implemented checkboxes and radio buttons to give users multiple or single selections, allowing for more dynamic and flexible data collection.

### 6. Accessibility:
- Focused on creating a user-friendly and accessible form by using proper labels, IDs, and making sure the form elements are navigable and clear to the user.

### 7. CSS Integration:
- Learned how to link external stylesheets (`styles.css`) to structure and style the form.

## Conclusion:
By working on this project, I gained a foundational understanding of form creation in HTML, the ability to handle different types of user inputs, and the basics of web accessibility and user interface design.
